THIS IS A LEARNING PROJECT. DO NOT USE WITH ANY ACTUAL ADA!   

Here's a  stab at a Simple Resource Allocation Voting Contract.  I've been learning about coding for over three weekends.
I also just spent over 45 minutes on this while watching reality TV tonight.   So, it's pretty much guaranteed to be perfect.

Hahahaha.   Actually, it's guaranteed to have massive problems, incorrect assumptions, and other gaping technical and conceptual 
problems.  I really am a clueless beginner at coding and this is just a working template I am slowly trying to turn into a 
semi-working smart contract based on a few raw beginner things I've learned (i.e. stole and then implemented incorrectly) from 
going through the @bobert sample SCs and a few Haskell tutorials.  It's an incomplete file with a lot of work left.    

But, if someone who actually knows what they are doing would like to throw out a few pointers, that would be awesome.
