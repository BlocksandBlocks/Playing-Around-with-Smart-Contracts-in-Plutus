      --could end up with vote tallies greater than zero.
      --The following are my probably incorrect assumptions about how this line above works:
      --”$$(P.” calls Prelude functions (e.g. in this case “foldr”),
      --this is different than "$" which just denotes a parenthetical,
      --”\” denotes a lambda (i.e. just a function without a name we’ll only use once),
      --”i” is just the argument we’re passing to the nameless function,
      --”greatherThanInteger (i+acc) 0” just checks if “(i+acc)” is greater than “0”,
      --”acc” is an accumulator (explained in “Folds and Horses” chapter in Learn you a Haskell), and
      --the "false" after the parenthetical is the starting point for the accumulator.
